# OpenManipulatorX

Worked on during University, using OpenManipulatorX robotic arm.

## Content

### Matlab-Simulink
OpenManipulatorX is simulated using Matlab/Simulink and Simscape Multibody library.
This was made to possibly get a mathematical model based on the simulations.

In the project, the input for every joint is the amount of movement it should do.
- for rotation we insert degree, in radian
- for translation we insert the lenght

### Manual for installing ROS and Gazebo on linux (Ubuntu 16.04.x, Ubuntu 20.04.x, Linux Mint 18.x)
!Manual is in Romanian language!

The manual was created to help the people who want to get started quickly with Open Manipulator X.
It includes:
- Installation tutorial for dual boot sistem.
- ROS installation tutorial for Ubuntu 16.04.x, Ubuntu 20.04.x and Linux Mint 18.x
- Description of communication interfaces with the robotic arm
- Matlab installation (not so detailed)
